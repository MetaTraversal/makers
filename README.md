# Makers

A Pilot Repository for the XROS Fellowship x Powersimple Project.

## Objective

This hybrid uses AFrame with Wordpress. We are looking forward to building the Aframe functions that would help us to edit or alter the progress in WebXR, while developing. A collection of experiences made with WebXR, which brings together AR and VR on the web to make them more convenient and widely accessible. Weâ€™re making it more viable by giving the accessibility to explore more with WebXR. Are you tired of switching back and forth between your text editor, the Inspector, and refreshing? Now you can save your changes from the Inspector directly to your HTML files. The Inspector has built-in support with a save button for the Watcher. Just make sure your entities have defined IDs.
